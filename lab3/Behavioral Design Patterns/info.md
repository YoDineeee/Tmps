Behavioral Design Patterns:
1) chain of responsibility Pattern :

*Represents sequential checks as a chain of handlers 
*Each  Handlers handles the situation or passes on the responsibility to the next  handler ..like this example:


```cpp
/**
 * The Handler interface declares a method for building the chain of handlers.
 * It also declares a method for executing a request.
 */
class Handler {
 public:
  virtual Handler *SetNext(Handler *handler) = 0;
  virtual std::string Handle(std::string request) = 0;
};
/**
 * The default chaining behavior can be implemented inside a base handler class.
 */
class AbstractHandler : public Handler {
 private:
  Handler *next_handler_;

 public:
  AbstractHandler() : next_handler_(nullptr) {
  }
  Handler *SetNext(Handler *handler) override {
    this->next_handler_ = handler;
    return handler;
  }
  std::string Handle(std::string request) override {
    if (this->next_handler_) {
      return this->next_handler_->Handle(request);
    }
    return {};
  }
};
/**
 * All Concrete Handlers either handle a request or pass it to the next handler
 * in the chain.
 */
class MonkeyHandler : public AbstractHandler {
 public:
  std::string Handle(std::string request) override {
    if (request == "Banana") {
      return "Monkey: I'll eat the " + request + ".\n";
    } else {
      return AbstractHandler::Handle(request);
    }
  }
};
class SquirrelHandler : public AbstractHandler {
 public:
  std::string Handle(std::string request) override {
    if (request == "Nut") {
      return "Squirrel: I'll eat the " + request + ".\n";
    } else {
      return AbstractHandler::Handle(request);
    }
  }
};
class DogHandler : public AbstractHandler {
 public:
  std::string Handle(std::string request) override {
    if (request == "MeatBall") {
      return "Dog: I'll eat the " + request + ".\n";
    } else {
      return AbstractHandler::Handle(request);
    }
  }
};
/**
 * The client code is usually suited to work with a single handler.
 */
void ClientCode(Handler &handler) {
  std::vector<std::string> food = {"Nut", "Banana", "Cup of coffee"};
  for (const std::string &f : food) {
    std::cout << "Client: Who wants a " << f << "?\n";
    const std::string result = handler.Handle(f);
    if (!result.empty()) {
      std::cout << "  " << result;
    } else {
      std::cout << "  " << f << " was left untouched.\n";
    }
  }
}
int main() {
  MonkeyHandler *monkey = new MonkeyHandler;
  SquirrelHandler *squirrel = new SquirrelHandler;
  DogHandler *dog = new DogHandler;
  monkey->SetNext(squirrel)->SetNext(dog);

  std::cout << "Chain: Monkey > Squirrel > Dog\n\n";
  ClientCode(*monkey);

  std::cout << "\nSubchain: Squirrel > Dog\n\n";
  ClientCode(*squirrel);

  delete monkey;
  delete squirrel;
  delete dog;

  return 0;
}
```


2) Command Method : 

tand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations

```cpp

/**
 * The Command interface declares a method for executing a command.
 */
class Command {
 public:
  virtual ~Command() {
  }
  virtual void Execute() const = 0;
};
/**
 * Some commands can implement simple operations on their own.
 */
class SimpleCommand : public Command {
 private:
  std::string pay_load_;

 public:
  explicit SimpleCommand(std::string pay_load) : pay_load_(pay_load) {
  }
  void Execute() const override {
    std::cout << "SimpleCommand: See, I can do simple things like printing (" << this->pay_load_ << ")\n";
  }
};

/**
 * The Receiver classes contain some important business logic. They know how to
 * perform all kinds of operations, associated with carrying out a request. In
 * fact, any class may serve as a Receiver.
 */
class Receiver {
 public:
  void DoSomething(const std::string &a) {
    std::cout << "Receiver: Working on (" << a << ".)\n";
  }
  void DoSomethingElse(const std::string &b) {
    std::cout << "Receiver: Also working on (" << b << ".)\n";
  }
};

/**
 * However, some commands can delegate more complex operations to other objects,
 * called "receivers."
 */
class ComplexCommand : public Command {
  /**
   * @var Receiver
   */
 private:
  Receiver *receiver_;
  /**
   * Context data, required for launching the receiver's methods.
   */
  std::string a_;
  std::string b_;
  /**
   * Complex commands can accept one or several receiver objects along with any
   * context data via the constructor.
   */
 public:
  ComplexCommand(Receiver *receiver, std::string a, std::string b) : receiver_(receiver), a_(a), b_(b) {
  }
  /**
   * Commands can delegate to any methods of a receiver.
   */
  void Execute() const override {
    std::cout << "ComplexCommand: Complex stuff should be done by a receiver object.\n";
    this->receiver_->DoSomething(this->a_);
    this->receiver_->DoSomethingElse(this->b_);
  }
};

/**
 * The Invoker is associated with one or several commands. It sends a request to
 * the command.
 */
class Invoker {
  /**
   * @var Command
   */
 private:
  Command *on_start_;
  /**
   * @var Command
   */
  Command *on_finish_;
  /**
   * Initialize commands.
   */
 public:
  ~Invoker() {
    delete on_start_;
    delete on_finish_;
  }

  void SetOnStart(Command *command) {
    this->on_start_ = command;
  }
  void SetOnFinish(Command *command) {
    this->on_finish_ = command;
  }
  /**
   * The Invoker does not depend on concrete command or receiver classes. The
   * Invoker passes a request to a receiver indirectly, by executing a command.
   */
  void DoSomethingImportant() {
    std::cout << "Invoker: Does anybody want something done before I begin?\n";
    if (this->on_start_) {
      this->on_start_->Execute();
    }
    std::cout << "Invoker: ...doing something really important...\n";
    std::cout << "Invoker: Does anybody want something done after I finish?\n";
    if (this->on_finish_) {
      this->on_finish_->Execute();
    }
  }
};
/**
 * The client code can parameterize an invoker with any commands.
 */

int main() {
  Invoker *invoker = new Invoker;
  invoker->SetOnStart(new SimpleCommand("Say Hi!"));
  Receiver *receiver = new Receiver;
  invoker->SetOnFinish(new ComplexCommand(receiver, "Send email", "Save report"));
  invoker->DoSomethingImportant();

  delete invoker;
  delete receiver;

  return 0;
}
```

3) Iterator Design:


Iterator is easy to recognize by the navigation methods (such as next, previous and others). Client code that uses iterators might not have direct access to the collection being traversed.

```cpp

/**
 * Iterator Design Pattern
 *
 * Intent: Lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its
 * underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).
 */

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

/**
 * C++ has its own implementation of iterator that works with a different
 * generics containers defined by the standard library.
 */

template <typename T, typename U>
class Iterator {
 public:
  typedef typename std::vector<T>::iterator iter_type;
  Iterator(U *p_data, bool reverse = false) : m_p_data_(p_data) {
    m_it_ = m_p_data_->m_data_.begin();
  }

  void First() {
    m_it_ = m_p_data_->m_data_.begin();
  }

  void Next() {
    m_it_++;
  }

  bool IsDone() {
    return (m_it_ == m_p_data_->m_data_.end());
  }

  iter_type Current() {
    return m_it_;
  }

 private:
  U *m_p_data_;
  iter_type m_it_;
};

/**
 * Generic Collections/Containers provides one or several methods for retrieving
 * fresh iterator instances, compatible with the collection class.
 */

template <class T>
class Container {
  friend class Iterator<T, Container>;

 public:
  void Add(T a) {
    m_data_.push_back(a);
  }

  Iterator<T, Container> *CreateIterator() {
    return new Iterator<T, Container>(this);
  }

 private:
  std::vector<T> m_data_;
};

class Data {
 public:
  Data(int a = 0) : m_data_(a) {}

  void set_data(int a) {
    m_data_ = a;
  }

  int data() {
    return m_data_;
  }

 private:
  int m_data_;
};

/**
 * The client code may or may not know about the Concrete Iterator or Collection
 * classes, for this implementation the container is generic so you can used
 * with an int or with a custom class.
 */
void ClientCode() {
  std::cout << "________________Iterator with int______________________________________" << std::endl;
  Container<int> cont;

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    cont.Add(i);
  }

  Iterator<int, Container<int>> *it = cont.CreateIterator();
  for (it->First(); !it->IsDone(); it->Next()) {
    std::cout << *it->Current() << std::endl;
  }

  Container<Data> cont2;
  Data a(100), b(1000), c(10000);
  cont2.Add(a);
  cont2.Add(b);
  cont2.Add(c);

  std::cout << "________________Iterator with custom Class______________________________" << std::endl;
  Iterator<Data, Container<Data>> *it2 = cont2.CreateIterator();
  for (it2->First(); !it2->IsDone(); it2->Next()) {
    std::cout << it2->Current()->data() << std::endl;
  }
  delete it;
  delete it2;
}

int main() {
  ClientCode();
  return 0;
}


```

4) Mediator Method:


 is example illustrates the structure of the Mediator design pattern. It focuses on answering these questions:

    What classes does it consist of?
    What roles do these classes play?
    In what way the elements of the pattern are related?


```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
/**
 * The Mediator interface declares a method used by components to notify the
 * mediator about various events. The Mediator may react to these events and
 * pass the execution to other components.
 */
class BaseComponent;
class Mediator {
 public:
  virtual void Notify(BaseComponent *sender, std::string event) const = 0;
};

/**
 * The Base Component provides the basic functionality of storing a mediator's
 * instance inside component objects.
 */
class BaseComponent {
 protected:
  Mediator *mediator_;

 public:
  BaseComponent(Mediator *mediator = nullptr) : mediator_(mediator) {
  }
  void set_mediator(Mediator *mediator) {
    this->mediator_ = mediator;
  }
};

/**
 * Concrete Components implement various functionality. They don't depend on
 * other components. They also don't depend on any concrete mediator classes.
 */
class Component1 : public BaseComponent {
 public:
  void DoA() {
    std::cout << "Component 1 does A.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "A");
  }
  void DoB() {
    std::cout << "Component 1 does B.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "B");
  }
};

class Component2 : public BaseComponent {
 public:
  void DoC() {
    std::cout << "Component 2 does C.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "C");
  }
  void DoD() {
    std::cout << "Component 2 does D.\n";
    this->mediator_->Notify(this, "D");
  }
};

/**
 * Concrete Mediators implement cooperative behavior by coordinating several
 * components.
 */
class ConcreteMediator : public Mediator {
 private:
  Component1 *component1_;
  Component2 *component2_;

 public:
  ConcreteMediator(Component1 *c1, Component2 *c2) : component1_(c1), component2_(c2) {
    this->component1_->set_mediator(this);
    this->component2_->set_mediator(this);
  }
  void Notify(BaseComponent *sender, std::string event) const override {
    if (event == "A") {
      std::cout << "Mediator reacts on A and triggers following operations:\n";
      this->component2_->DoC();
    }
    if (event == "D") {
      std::cout << "Mediator reacts on D and triggers following operations:\n";
      this->component1_->DoB();
      this->component2_->DoC();
    }
  }
};

/**
 * The client code.
 */

void ClientCode() {
  Component1 *c1 = new Component1;
  Component2 *c2 = new Component2;
  ConcreteMediator *mediator = new ConcreteMediator(c1, c2);
  std::cout << "Client triggers operation A.\n";
  c1->DoA();
  std::cout << "\n";
  std::cout << "Client triggers operation D.\n";
  c2->DoD();

  delete c1;
  delete c2;
  delete mediator;
}

int main() {
  ClientCode();
  return 0;
}

```
