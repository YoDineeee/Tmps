Designs Patterns ---> so basically an already made strategies to solve the common issues in development 
                    so i can imagine this like a general who have experiance in war ..advices on it 

with this strategies ..usually (on what we are going to learn) it devieded to--> Creational Patterns |Structural Patterns|Behavioral Patterns

--->  Creational --> Class Instantiation 
--->  Structural --> Store Information 
--->  Behavioral --> Communication Between Objects

"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again ... and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without doing it the same way twice." -- Christopher Alexander

Goal:  to help make your software more flexible and reusable 

but why we study this shit ?:
    its easy to make products but its hard to maintain it 
    ( something similar to this ...easy to be in the top but its hard to be still in the top )

    Patterns are for Reuse



## List of the Original Patterns

## What does the pattern consist of?
Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.

Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.

Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.

Code example is one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
