"Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again ... and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without doing it the same way twice." -- Christopher Alexander

Goal:  to help make your software more flexible and reusable

    its easy to make products but its hard to maintain it 
    ( something similar to this ...easy to be in the top but its hard to be still in the top )

    Patterns are for Reuse
