## Theory

SOLID is a collection of design principles that guide developers toward building software thatâ€™s easier to understand, maintain, and evolve. Following these rules leads to architectures that are more modular, resilient to change, and simpler to extend without introducing bugs.

The SOLID principles are:

* Single Responsibility Principle
  * *One class, one reason to change.*
* Open-Closed Principle.
  * *Design modules so you can add features by extending them, not by editing them.*
* Liskov Substitution Principle.
  * *Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.*
* Interface Segregation Principle
  * *Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.*
* Dependency Inversion Principle
  * *Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretes.*
## Objectives:

* Get familiar with SOLID principles in designing software.
* Implement 3 SOLID principles in a simple project.
